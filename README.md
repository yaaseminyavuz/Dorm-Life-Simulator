# DormLife Simulator 🏫🎮

DormLife Simulator is an event-driven dormitory management simulation game
developed in Java using Swing.  
The project focuses on demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
principles through a realistic dormitory management scenario.

This project was developed as part of a Java OOP laboratory module.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal of the project is to manage a dormitory by making daily decisions
in response to various events such as noise complaints, maintenance failures,
internet outages, and lost items.

Each decision affects dormitory statistics including:
- Budget
- Happiness
- Discipline
- Cleanliness
- Safety

The simulation encourages strategic thinking while clearly showcasing OOP
design principles.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview
- The game progresses day by day.
- Each day, a random dormitory event occurs.
- The player chooses one of three possible actions.
- Actions impact dormitory statistics based on the selected management policy.
- The game ends after a fixed number of days or when critical resources are depleted.
